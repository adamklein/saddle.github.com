==========================
Saddle: Scala Data Library
==========================

Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Saddle is a data manipulation library for Scala_ that provides array-backed,
indexed, one- and two-dimensional data structures that are judiciously
specialized on JVM primitives to avoid the overhead of boxing and unboxing.

Saddle offers vectorized numerical calculations, automatic alignment of data
along indices, robustness to missing (N/A) values, and facilities for I/O.

Saddle draws inspiration from several sources, among them the R_ programming
language & statistical environment, the numpy_ and pandas_ Python_ libraries,
and the Scala collections library.
